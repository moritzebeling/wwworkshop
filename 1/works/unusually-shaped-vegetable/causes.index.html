      Vegetables usually grow into an unusual shape due to environmental conditions. <br />
      Damage to one part of the vegetable can cause the growth to slow in that area while the rest grows at the normal rate. <br />
      When a root vegetable is growing and the tip is damaged, it can sometimes split, forming multiple roots attached at one point. <br />
      If a plant is in the primordium (embryonic development) stage, damage to the growing vegetable can cause more extreme mutations.[1]

      The unusual shape can also be forced upon the vegetable. <br />
      In Japan, farmers of the Zentsuji region found a way to grow cubic watermelons by growing the fruits in glass boxes and letting them naturally assume the shape of the receptacle.<br />
      The square-shaped watermelon was intended to make the melons easier to stack and store, but because the melons must be picked before they are ripe they're inedible; <br />
      the cubic watermelons are also often more than double the price of normal watermelons.[2] <br />
      Using similar techniques, growers have also created more complex shapes of watermelon, including dice, pyramids, and faces.[3]

      Root vegetables, especially those such as carrots and parsnips, will naturally grow around or avoid obstacles in the soil such as small stones and other foreign objects to prevent damage to the developing root, resulting in a wide variety of different shapes.[4]
