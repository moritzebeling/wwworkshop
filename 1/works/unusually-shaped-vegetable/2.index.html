          An unusually shaped vegetable is a vegetable or fruit that has grown into a shape not in line with its normal body plan. <br />
          While some examples are just oddly shaped, others are heralded for their amusing appearance, often because they resemble a body part such as the buttocks or genitalia. <br />
          Pareidolia can be common in vegetables, with some people reporting the appearance of religious imagery. <br />
