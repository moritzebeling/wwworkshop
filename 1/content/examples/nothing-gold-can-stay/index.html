<h1>Nothing Gold Can Stay</1>
    <p>Nature's first green is gold,<br/>
    Her hardest hue to hold.<br/>
    Her early leaf's a flower;<br/>
    But only so an hour.<br/>
    Then leaf subsides to leaf.<br/>
    So Eden sank to grief,<br/>
    So dawn goes down to day.<br/>
      Nothing gold can stay.</p>
