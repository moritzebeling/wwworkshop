    <p class="titel">this is just to say</p>

    <p> I have eaten<br>
      the <span id="plum">plums</span><br>
      that were in<br>
      the icebox
      <p />

    <p> and which <br>
      you were probably<br>
      saving<br>
      for breakfast
      <p />

    <p>Forgive me<br>
      they were delicious<br>
      so sweet<br>
      and so cold</p>
