# Assignment 1:<br />Text formatting

As we now know, HTML can be used to bring a semantic structure to a text document.

1. Go on the internet and search for a small poem you like. Maybe together with some context like title, author, year? Copy and paste that to your editor and clean up the text. Compare your text input to the visual output.

2. Use HTML to bring the raw text into a structure that best represents the content structure. Go to the [full list of HTML elements](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp) and pick what you need.

(Todo: Examples?)

3. Now use CSS to style your poem and make it beautiful. Maybe some [spacing](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp) between elements? [Text and background](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_colors.asp) [colors](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_colors_rgb.asp)?

If youâ€™re done with these task very quickly, try another, more challanging example :)
