# Welcome

In this workshop we will look at the 2 most basic web technologies: **HTML and CSS**. We will not attempt to build a full website, but approach the topic by **experimenting with small code snippets** that cover many important techniques of web design.
The goal is that all participants **collaborate on building an archive** of code snippets that will be continously collected on this website, so that they can be used by the group.

## You will need
- Computer with internet access, webcam, microphone
- Modern web browser like Chrome, Safari or Firefox
- When using Safari, please activate the developer tools (Settings > Advanced > Show developer tools)

## Timetable
