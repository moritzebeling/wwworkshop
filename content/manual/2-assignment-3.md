# Assignment 3: Transforms, transitions, animations

Until now, HTML elements are very rectangular for us. But luckily there are some things that we can do about it:

- `border-radius` for round corners
- `transform` to manipulate the appeareance of an element
- `gradients` as background color
- Mouse interactions using the `:hover` pseudo-selector
- `transitions` to morph between diffenrent states
- `animations` to animate an element once or continously
- `:hover` selector to check if the mouse is over an element

1. We will now use those to make geometrical artworks from A.2 even more fun. You can either fork an existing pen or create a new artwork.

## Some examples

<iframe height="360" src="/examples/hover-me/embed"></iframe>

> Use `:hover` in combination with `transition`. Note how the background is a sibling element to the button and still can be animated using the `+` combinator. Play with it on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/moritzebeling/pen/RwpjxaY)
