# Assignment 3:<br />Mouse interactions & animations

Luckily websites are not only a medium to consume, but also to intertact with. One very simple typoe of interaction is hovering an element with the mouse cursor.

1. Create a button and place it at the center of the screen. Try to come up with a fun or interesting button text.

2. Use the `:hover` pseudo selector to change the visual style of the button when hovering it.

3. Use CSS transitions to animate inbetween the normal and the hover state.
