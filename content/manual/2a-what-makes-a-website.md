# What makes a Website?

A website is basically a collection of files that can be interpreted by a browser and displayed as a website. There are 3 fundamental technologies to make this happen: HTML, CSS and JS.

## ðŸ“‘ HTML
The most basic configuration of a website consits of just on single file: `index.html`. HTML stands for **Hypertext Markup Language**. It is basically a text document that contains structured content, meaning that HTML is used to define the various sections of a document, like paragraphs, a headline or invisible metadata, so that the browser can identify and differentiate them.

To make a website more rich, you can add more HTML files to represent multiple pages on your website and also images, webfonts, CSS and JS.

Letâ€™s look at some text without HTML:

<iframe height="360" src="/examples/er-ists-1/embed"></iframe>

The source code is on the left, the rendered website on the right. You can see, that the headline and all the linebreaks are not shown. Therefore we need HTML:

<iframe height="460" src="/examples/er-ists-2/embed"></iframe>

We now told the browser, what the **h**eadline and the **p**aragraphy are and where to but line breaks.

## ðŸŽ¨ CSS
The second fundamental web technology is **Cascading Style Sheets**. It is also a text-like document that you can use to instruct the browser on how the different sections of the HTML document should appear.
So HTML brings the structured content and CSS knows how this structure should look like in terms of layout, color or typography.

<iframe height="460" src="/examples/er-ists-3/embed?html=false"></iframe>

Above you have a comparison of some unstructured text as input on the left, and on the right the output as the browser would render that.

## ðŸ’« JS
The third fundamental web technology is **JavaScript**, which is a programming language that runs inside the browser once a visitor has opened a website. It can be used to change and manipulate both HTML and CSS as well as adding interactivity or time based events.
