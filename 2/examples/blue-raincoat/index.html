<h1>Famous Blue Raincoat</h1>

<p> It's four in the morning, the end of December<br />
  I'm writing you now just to see if you're better<br />
  New York is cold, but I like where I'm living<br />
  There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening<br />
  I hear that you're building
  Your little house deep in the desert<br />
  You're living for nothing now<br />
  I hope you're keeping some kind of record
