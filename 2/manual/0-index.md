# Welcome

In this workshop we will look at the most basic web technologies that (almost) every website is made of: **HTML, CSS, JS**. We will approach the topic by **experimenting with small code snippets** that cover many important techniques of web design.
The goal is that all participants **collaborate on building an archive** of code snippets that will be continously collected on this website, so that they can be used by everyone.

## Setup
- Modern web **browser** like Chrome, Safari or Firefox. When using Safari, please enable the developer tools (Settings > Advanced > Show developer tools).
- **Free account** on CodePen
