# Assignment 3: Transforms, transitions, animations

Until now, HTML elements are very rectangular for us. But luckily there are some things that we can do about it:

- [`border-radius`](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_border-radius.asp) for round corners
- [`transform`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transform/) to manipulate the appeareance of an element
- [`gradients`](https://cssgradient.io) as background color
- Mouse interactions using the [`:hover`](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.asp) pseudo-selector
- [`transition`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transition/) to morph between diffenrent states
- [`animation`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/animation/) to animate an element once or continously

1. We will now use those to make geometrical artworks from A.2 even more fun. You can either fork an existing pen or create a new artwork.

## Some examples

<iframe height="360" src="/2/embed/examples/hover-me"></iframe>

> Use `:hover` in combination with `transition`. Note how the background is a sibling element to the button and still can be animated using the `+` combinator. Play with it on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/moritzebeling/pen/RwpjxaY)

> CSS `animation` in combination with `position`. Play with it on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/moritzebeling/pen/OJpOzgY)

## Sharing our work

Once youâ€™re done, share it with your groupmates and also do not forget to [send it to me](/manual/4a-sharing), so that it can be included on this website.
This task is very well suited to produce 2 or even more pens.
