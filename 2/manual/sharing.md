# Sharing and submitting your work

The idea of this workshop is, that everyone shares their work so that we can collect it here on this website. Since we’re all beginners and just here for the fun, it is totally okay to share both unfinished work or simple experiments – as well as perfected snippets.

1. Save your CodePen and you will now get a unique URL. Once you do changes to your project, the URL will stay the same, but whenever someone opens the link, they will see the current version

2. If you need help or want to show something interesting you worked on, share the link with your peers

3. If you want to submit your pen to this website, send the pen URL to email@moritzebeling.com. This is not a perfect solution, maybe we find out some better way. I will then copy your code and include it into the website.
Please do this every time once you finish a pen, so that the archive can grow during hte time of the workshop.
