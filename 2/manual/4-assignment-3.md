# Assignment 3: Transforms, transitions, animations

Until now, our sketches are quite rectengular and static.
Today we wanâ€™t to continue with our geometrical patterns and sketches, but add effects, animations, interactions, ...

1. Fork one of your existing sketches or quickly start a new one. Play around with the following properties to make your HTML elements less boxy:

- [`border-radius`](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_border-radius.asp) for round corners
- [`transform`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transform/) to manipulate the appeareance of an element
- [`gradients`](https://cssgradient.io) as background color
- Mouse interactions using the [`:hover`](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.asp) pseudo-selector
- [`box-shadow`](https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow)

These links might help you:
- Our small [CSS Reference](/2/manual/CSS-reference.html)
- Google `CSS ... generator`, `CSS effects`, `CSS animation`, `CSS ...`

2. Use the `:hover` pseudo-class to manipulate properties:

```
h1 {
    color: red;
}
h1:hover {
    color: blue;
}
```

3. Use [`transition`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transition/) to morph between diffenrent states.

> Use `:hover` in combination with `transition`. Note how the background is a sibling element to the button and still can be animated using the `+` combinator. Play with it on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/moritzebeling/pen/RwpjxaY)

4. Another way to add movement to our skteches is with [`animation`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/animation/). While `transition` only alternates between 2 states, a CSS `animation` can follow a complex chain of keyframes.
Fork or start a new pen to create a small animation.
