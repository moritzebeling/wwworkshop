# Welcome

In this workshop we will look at the 2 most basic web technologies that (almost) every website is made of: **HTML and CSS**. Instead of building a full website, we will approach the topic by **experimenting with small code snippets** that cover many important techniques of web design.
The goal is that all participants **collaborate on building an archive** of code snippets that will be continously collected on this website, so that they can be used by everyone.

## Setup
- **Computer** with internet access, webcam, microphone
- Modern web **browser** like Chrome, Safari or Firefox. When using Safari, please enable the developer tools (Settings > Advanced > Show developer tools).
- We should create either a Telegram or Signal chat so that we quickly can share stuff
- Maybe bookmark this very website, so you can quickly find back to it
-
- We will mostly work with [CodePen](https://codepen.io), an **online code editor**, that is perfectly suited for our workshop. Please sign up for a **free account**, which is needed to save and share your projects.
